### Usage
* Run to the MCP server via `npx`, command:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=TEST
```

_Optionally_, if the environment is LIVE then you must also provide your Merchant URL, for example:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=LIVE --livePrefix=YOUR_PREFIX_URL
```


Example usage in `.vscode`:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "adyen-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@adyen/mcp", "--adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY", "--env=TEST"],
      "env": {
        "ADYEN_API_KEY": "${ADYEN_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** To run certain functionality (tools) in the mcp-server, you need a webservice user with the following roles: 
* Management API - Accounts Read
* Management API - Payment methods Read
* Checkout Webservice Role
* Merchant PAL Webservice Role

Adyen recommends creating a new webservice user and generating a new API key for the purpose of this application.
Only use the new userâ€™s API key for the MCP application and limit the roles to match the tools you'll be using.
