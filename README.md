It currently supports the following tools. Read more on our [Blog - Part 1](https://www.adyen.com/knowledge-hub/mcp-release).

   - Get the available payment methods
2. CheckoutAPI - Payment Links
   - Gets the status of a payment link
   - Create a payment link
   - Updates a payment link (force expiry of the link)
4. Modifications API - Cancel / Refund

### Usage
* Run to the MCP server via `npx`, command:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=TEST
```

_Optionally_, if the environment is LIVE then you must also provide your Merchant URL, for example:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=LIVE --livePrefix=YOUR_PREFIX_URL
```


Example usage in `.vscode`:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "adyen-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@adyen/mcp", "--adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY", "--env=TEST"],
      "env": {
        "ADYEN_API_KEY": "${ADYEN_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** To run certain functionality (tools) in the mcp-server, you need a webservice user with the following roles: 
* Management API - Accounts Read
* Management API - Payment methods Read
* Checkout Webservice Role
* Merchant PAL Webservice Role

Adyen recommends creating a new webservice user and generating a new API key for the purpose of this application.
Only use the new user’s API key for the MCP application and limit the roles to match the tools you'll be using.
